A library for statistical and otherwise computations involving physical quantities: quantities with both a physical dimension, and a value _and uncertainty specification_.

**Warning**: most of this library is very badly organised (the whole including order is wrapped up; even though it is not really a template library everything is one compilation unit) and much is not optimally implemented. But there are some rather powerful routines in it, particularly the Monte-Carlo-based nonlinear function fitting facilities (`evolution_minimizer`) which can in particular be used to automatically fit whole spectra of possibly overlapping peaks (`ffit_spectrum`), and the kernel-density-estimation based perfectly-smooth (infinitely differentiable) generic measure fitters (`smooth_unsample`).
